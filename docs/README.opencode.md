# Text2Prod for OpenCode

Complete guide for using Text2Prod with [OpenCode.ai](https://opencode.ai).

## Installation

Add text2prod to the `plugin` array in your `opencode.json` (global or project-level):

```json
{
  "plugin": ["text2prod@git+https://github.com/phuongddx/text2prod.git"]
}
```

Restart OpenCode. The plugin installs through OpenCode's plugin manager and
registers all skills.

Verify by asking: "Tell me about your text2prod"

OpenCode uses its own plugin install. If you also use Claude Code, Codex, or
another harness, install Text2Prod separately for each one.

### Migrating from the old symlink-based install

If you previously installed text2prod using `git clone` and symlinks, remove the old setup:

```bash
# Remove old symlinks
rm -f ~/.config/opencode/plugins/text2prod.js
rm -rf ~/.config/opencode/skills/text2prod

# Optionally remove the cloned repo
rm -rf ~/.config/opencode/text2prod

# Remove skills.paths from opencode.json if you added one for text2prod
```

Then follow the installation steps above.

## Usage

### Finding Skills

Use OpenCode's native `skill` tool to list all available skills:

```
use skill tool to list skills
```

### Loading a Skill

```
use skill tool to load brainstorming
```

### Personal Skills

Create your own skills in `~/.config/opencode/skills/`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills/my-skill
```

Create `~/.config/opencode/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Use when [condition] - [what it does]
---

# My Skill

[Your skill content here]
```

### Project Skills

Create project-specific skills in `.opencode/skills/` within your project.

**Skill Priority:** Project skills > Personal skills > Text2Prod skills

## Updating

OpenCode installs Text2Prod through a git-backed package spec. Some OpenCode
and Bun versions pin that resolved git dependency in a lockfile or cache, so a
restart may not pick up the newest Text2Prod commit. If updates do not appear,
clear OpenCode's package cache or reinstall the plugin.

To pin a specific version, use a branch or tag:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["text2prod@git+https://github.com/phuongddx/text2prod.git"]
}
```

## How It Works

The plugin does two things:

1. **Injects bootstrap context** via the `experimental.chat.messages.transform` hook, adding text2prod awareness to every conversation.
2. **Registers the skills directory** via the `config` hook, so OpenCode discovers all text2prod skills without symlinks or manual config.

### Tool Mapping

Skills speak in actions rather than naming any one runtime's tools. On OpenCode these resolve to:

- "Create a todo" / "mark complete in todo list" → `todowrite`
- `Subagent (general-purpose):` template → OpenCode's `task` tool with `subagent_type: "general"` (or `"explore"` for codebase exploration)
- "Invoke a skill" → OpenCode's native `skill` tool
- "Read a file" → `read`
- "Create a file" / "edit a file" / "delete a file" → `apply_patch`
- "Run a shell command" → `bash`
- "Search file contents" / "find files by name" → `grep`, `glob`
- "Fetch a URL" → `webfetch`

(Verified against the installed OpenCode CLI's tool inventory.)

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not loading

1. Check OpenCode logs: `opencode run --print-logs "hello" 2>&1 | grep -i text2prod`
2. Verify the plugin line in your `opencode.json` is correct
3. Make sure you're running a recent version of OpenCode

### Windows install issues

Some Windows OpenCode builds have upstream installer issues with git-backed
plugin specs, including cache paths for `git+https` URLs and Bun not finding
`git.exe` even when it works in a normal terminal. If OpenCode cannot install
the plugin, try installing with system npm and pointing OpenCode at the local
package:

```powershell
npm install text2prod@git+https://github.com/phuongddx/text2prod.git --prefix "$HOME\.config\opencode"
```

Then use the installed package path in `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["~/.config/opencode/node_modules/text2prod"]
}
```

### Skills not found

1. Use OpenCode's `skill` tool to list available skills
2. Check that the plugin is loading (see above)
3. Each skill needs a `SKILL.md` file with valid YAML frontmatter

### Bootstrap not appearing

1. Check OpenCode version supports `experimental.chat.messages.transform` hook
2. Restart OpenCode after config changes
