# Text2Prod

Text2Prod is a complete software development methodology for your coding agents, built on top of a set of composable skills and some initial instructions that make sure your agent uses them.

## How it works

It starts from the moment you fire up your coding agent. As soon as it sees that you're building something, it *doesn't* just jump into trying to write code. Instead, it steps back and asks you what you're really trying to do. 

Once it's teased a spec out of the conversation, it shows it to you in chunks short enough to actually read and digest. 

After you've signed off on the design, your agent puts together an implementation plan that's clear enough for an enthusiastic junior engineer with poor taste, no judgement, no project context, and an aversion to testing to follow. It emphasizes true red/green TDD, YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and DRY. 

Next up, once you say "go", it launches a *subagent-driven-development* process, having agents work through each engineering task, inspecting and reviewing their work, and continuing forward. It's not uncommon for your agent to work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.

There's a bunch more to it, but that's the core of the system. And because the skills trigger automatically, you don't need to do anything special. Your coding agent just has Text2Prod.

## Installation

Installation differs by harness. If you use more than one, install Text2Prod separately for each one.

### Claude Code

Text2Prod is a local plugin — install from this repository.

#### Official Marketplace

- Install the plugin from Anthropic's official marketplace:

  ```bash
  # local install: run from this repository
  ```

#### Text2Prod Marketplace

The Text2Prod marketplace provides Text2Prod and some other related plugins for Claude Code.

- Register the marketplace:

  ```bash
  # local install: run from this repository
  ```

- Install the plugin from this marketplace:

  ```bash
  # local install: run from this repository
  ```

### Antigravity

Install Text2Prod as a plugin from this repository:

```bash
agy plugin install ./
```

Antigravity runs the plugin's session-start hook, so Text2Prod is active from
the first message. Reinstall with the same command to update.

### Codex App

Text2Prod is available via the [official Codex plugin marketplace](https://github.com/openai/plugins).

- In the Codex app, click on Plugins in the sidebar.
- You should see `Text2Prod` in the Coding section.
- Click the `+` next to Text2Prod and follow the prompts.

### Codex CLI

Text2Prod is available via the [official Codex plugin marketplace](https://github.com/openai/plugins).

- Open the plugin search interface:

  ```bash
  /plugins
  ```

- Search for Text2Prod:

  ```bash
  text2prod
  ```

- Select `Install Plugin`.

### Cursor

- In Cursor Agent chat, install from marketplace:

  ```text
  /add-plugin text2prod
  ```

- Or search for "text2prod" in the plugin marketplace.

### Devin CLI

- Install the plugin from this repository:

  ```bash
  devin plugins install ./
  ```

- Update to the latest version with:

  ```bash
  devin plugins update text2prod
  ```

### Factory Droid

- Register the marketplace:

  ```bash
  # local install: run from this repository
  ```

- Install the plugin:

  ```bash
  droid plugin install text2prod@text2prod
  ```

### Gemini CLI

- Install the extension:

  ```bash
  gemini extensions install ./
  ```

- Update later:

  ```bash
  gemini extensions update text2prod
  ```

### GitHub Copilot CLI

- Register the marketplace:

  ```bash
  # local install: run from this repository
  ```

- Install the plugin:

  ```bash
  # local install: run from this repository
  ```

### Grok Build CLI

Text2Prod is a local plugin — install from this repository.

- Install the plugin from xAI's official marketplace:

  ```bash
  # local install: run from this repository
  ```

- Or open the marketplace in the TUI, search for Text2Prod, and install it:

  ```text
  /marketplace
  ```

### Kimi Code

Text2Prod is available in Kimi Code's plugin marketplace.

- Open Kimi Code's plugin manager:

  ```text
  /plugins
  ```

- Go to `Marketplace` > `Text2Prod` and install it.

- Or install directly from this repository:

  ```text
  /plugins install ./
  ```

- Detailed docs: [docs/README.kimi.md](docs/README.kimi.md)

### OpenCode

OpenCode uses its own plugin install; install Text2Prod separately even if you
already use it in another harness.

- Tell OpenCode:

  ```
  Follow docs/README.opencode.md in this repository.
  ```

- Detailed docs: [docs/README.opencode.md](docs/README.opencode.md)

### Pi

Install Text2Prod as a Pi package from this repository:

```bash
pi install ./
```

For local development, run Pi with this checkout loaded as a temporary package:

```bash
pi -e /path/to/text2prod
```

The Pi package loads the Text2Prod skills and a small extension that injects the `using-text2prod` bootstrap at session startup and again after compaction. Pi has native skills, so no compatibility `Skill` tool is required. Subagent and task-list tools remain optional Pi companion packages.

### Hermes Agent

Install Text2Prod as a Hermes plugin from this repository:

```bash
hermes plugins install ./ --enable
```

Restart any active Hermes sessions after installing. Note: Hermes has no
post-compaction hook, so a very long session that compacts over its first
turn loses the bootstrap — start a fresh session if skills stop triggering.

## The Basic Workflow

1. **brainstorming** - Activates before writing code. Refines rough ideas through questions, explores alternatives, presents design in sections for validation. Saves design document.

2. **using-git-worktrees** - Activates after design approval. Creates isolated workspace on new branch, runs project setup, verifies clean test baseline.

3. **writing-plans** - Activates with approved design. Breaks work into bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each). Every task has exact file paths, complete code, verification steps.

4. **subagent-driven-development** or **executing-plans** - Activates with plan. Dispatches fresh subagent per task with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality), or executes in batches with human checkpoints.

5. **test-driven-development** - Activates during implementation. Enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: write failing test, watch it fail, write minimal code, watch it pass, commit. Deletes code written before tests.

6. **requesting-code-review** - Activates between tasks. Reviews against plan, reports issues by severity. Critical issues block progress.

7. **finishing-a-development-branch** - Activates when tasks complete. Verifies tests, presents options (merge/PR/keep/discard), cleans up worktree.

**The agent checks for relevant skills before any task.** Mandatory workflows, not suggestions.

## Contributing

The general contribution process for Text2Prod is below. Keep in mind that we don't generally accept contributions of new skills and that any updates to skills must work across all of the coding agents we support.

1. Fork the repository
2. Switch to the 'dev' branch
3. Create a branch for your work
4. Follow the `writing-skills` skill for creating and testing new and modified skills
5. Submit a PR, being sure to fill in the pull request template.

Skill-behavior tests use the drill eval harness from [text2prod-evals](https://github.com/prime-radiant-inc/text2prod-evals/), cloned into `evals/` — see `evals/README.md` for setup. Plugin-infrastructure tests live at `tests/` and run via the relevant `run-*.sh` or `npm test`.

See `skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md` for the complete guide.

## Updating

Text2Prod updates are somewhat coding-agent dependent, but are often automatic.

## License

## Visual companion telemetry

Because skills and plugins don't provide any feedback to creators, we have no idea how many of you are using Text2Prod. By default, the Prime Radiant logo on brainstorming's optional visual companion feature is loaded from our website. It includes the version of Text2Prod in use. It does not include any details about your project, prompt, or coding agent. We don't see your clicks or anything about what you're building. This helps us have a rough idea of how many folks are using Text2Prod and which version of Text2Prod they're using. It's 100% optional. To disable this, set the environment variable `TEXT2PROD_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` to any true value. Text2Prod also honors Claude Code's `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` and `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` opt-outs.
